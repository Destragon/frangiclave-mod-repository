# Consistent lore upgrades

This mod removes randomness from the process of upgrading and subverting lore.
The research process now takes 2 minutes in total, and always asks for an
Erudition, a Glimmering, and a Reason, in that order.  The research process
will succeed if and only if these needs are met.

This mod will make the research process significantly faster, and easier, in
two ways: you always know ahead of time what you will need, and the Study verb
is not tied up in this process for such a long time period.
